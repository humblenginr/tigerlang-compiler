Ticomp is a compiler written for the Tiger programming language, which is a simple, statically-typed, procedural programming language of the Algo family.
Tiger has 4 main types: integer, string, array and record. The language has support for control flow with if statement, while loop, for loop, functions and nested functions.
The compiler is built using Ocaml and LLVM (as the backend-infrastructure). I am building Ticomp just for my learning purpose.
